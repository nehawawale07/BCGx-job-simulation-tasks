Overview
As part of the BCGx job simulation, I completed tasks involving detailed data analysis and predictive modeling. The primary focus was on conducting comprehensive EDA and developing models to predict customer churn based on provided datasets.

Task Details
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involved the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
Data Visualization: Creating various plots (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, etc.) to understand the data distribution, trends, and patterns.
Feature Engineering: Identifying and creating new features to enhance model performance.
Statistical Analysis: Performing statistical tests to derive insights and understand relationships between variables.
Key insights from the EDA included identifying significant variables impacting customer behavior and trends within the dataset.

2. Churn Analysis
The churn analysis aimed to predict customer churn using the following steps:

Data Preparation: Splitting the dataset into training and test sets and scaling features where necessary.
Model Building: Implementing various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.) to predict churn.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC metrics.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning models using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for optimal performance.
The analysis provided a deep understanding of customer churn drivers and helped develop strategies for retention.
